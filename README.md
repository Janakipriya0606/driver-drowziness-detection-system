# driver-drowziness-detection-system
A low-cost, hardware-based Driver Drowsiness Detection System built using Arduino. This system helps prevent accidents by detecting signs of drowsiness in the driver through real-time eye-blink analysis using an IR sensor or eye blink module, and triggers an alert using a buzzer or vibration motor.
